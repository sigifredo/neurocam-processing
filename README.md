# NeuroCAM processing

This is a project by the NeuroCAM research group at the University of Antioquia. Its aim is to read the signals provided by the NeuroSky device and, based on the received data, mix a series of videos.

This project builds upon the code developed by Guan Yang (github user 'guanix') in the 'processing-neurosky' repository. This repository offers a simple Processing library for reading data from NeuroSky EEG headsets, specifically supporting the MindWave headset. It includes a sketch, 'mindwave.pde', that visualizes basic information from the headset.
